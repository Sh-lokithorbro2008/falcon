                <p>WHEN WE THINK OF TRAVELLING, WE THINK FROM THE DEFAULT "ADULT" VIEW. GROWN-UPS USUALLY FORGET IF THE KIDS WILL LIKE IT OR NOT. AND WHEN THE KIDS REALIZE THE PLACE IS BORING IT IS USUALLY TOO LATE AND THERE HAVE BEEN CASES WHERE THE KIDS WENT EITHER CRAZY OR DIED OUT FROM BOREDOM.
WE ALWAYS NEED TO GO TO A PLACE WHERE THERE IS MORE CHILD-NOT-DIEINGNESS. AND THE BEST PLACE TO DO THIS IS TO ASK THEM. I TELL THIS BECAUSE MY PARENTS HAD ONCE DONE THIS TO ME.BYE.</p>
